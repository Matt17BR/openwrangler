# Changelog

All notable changes to Open Wrangler are documented here. The project follows Semantic Versioning while prerelease versions remain unstable.

## [0.3.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Added a native, lazy DuckDB file backend for UTF-8 CSV/TSV, Parquet, and JSONL viewing, profiling, all 27 deterministic operations, executable code generation, draft/history workflows, and atomic CSV/Parquet export without conversion through Pandas, Polars, or Arrow.
- Added opt-in Pandas and DuckDB runtime benchmark modes with deterministic synthetic fixtures, native/lazy frame evidence, machine and package provenance, process-memory samples, and an explicit boundary separating runtime timings from editor first paint. Polars remains the strict release-performance gate.
- Added pull-request CodeQL analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, cross-platform pull-request runtime coverage, canonical single-artifact release validation, and repository rules protecting `main` and `v*` release tags.

### Changed

- Established the Open Wrangler identity across the VS Code package, bundled runtime, protocol schema, repository metadata, documentation, test harnesses, and release artifacts.
- Consolidated commands, settings, custom-editor state, and notebook rendering on the canonical `openWrangler.*` namespace and MIME v2 identifier.
- Removed the unused pre-release identity and compatibility paths instead of carrying aliases or migrations into the experimental package.
- Refreshed real installed-VSIX evidence from fixture-only VS Code and Cursor profiles without development-workspace diagnostics or test-host title chrome.
- Replaced shared engine singletons with ordered factories and session-owned adapters, including diagnostic cleanup on failed opens, explicit close, runtime shutdown, and transient notebook rendering. Extension deactivation now awaits terminal session cleanup across standalone and Jupyter runtimes, while normal Python-process stops use bounded stdin/EOF shutdown before force-kill fallback.
- Refreshed the product description to state the open-source dataframe-wrangling purpose directly and documented the project's independent inspiration from Microsoft Data Wrangler.
- Deferred all live-session profiling until after the exact first grid, added correlated progressive view queries with interactive-over-background scheduling, and bounded each session's page cache by entries and payload weight.
- Made opaque logical-view contexts authoritative across the webview, retained panel snapshot, and native Activity Bar state; superseded pages and pre-recovery runtime responses can no longer overwrite current metadata. Foreground failures, profiling diagnostics, queued-view cancellation, retryable pages, and per-profile retries are isolated from one another.
- Allowed foreground paging to execute beside an immutable profiling lease while keeping transformations, exports, and close exclusive with writer preference. Recovery now retires the replaced runtime session transactionally, and a shutdown that reaches its grace bound still closes a live-kernel session after active work settles.
- Removed the lazy-Polars all-column null scan from initial schema discovery, kept exact summary counts in native Polars aggregations, sampled deterministic valid numeric values for charts, and normalized Pandas/Polars null-versus-NaN counts.
- Made notebook-kernel requests use the same canonical protocol-v2 success, error, cancellation, and correlation envelopes as the standalone runtime so logical dataframe errors remain recoverable responses.
- Made lazy file sessions detect source replacement, resize, schema changes, and deletion before cached metadata can diverge from newly read rows; affected sessions now request an explicit reopen while remaining safely closable.
- Hardened performance evidence with atomic fixture-contract validation, honest first-sample versus warm-source metrics, native lazy-profile measurements, and cache/session cleanup assertions.
- Added canonical stdio protocol round-trip and instrumented active-profile overlap gates with a release-blocking 500ms cache-miss ceiling, and limited cancellation acknowledgements to work that was genuinely still queued so running results remain authoritative.
- Made the bundled Python runtime version a package-wide source of truth and added a documentation gate that rejects extension/runtime prerelease drift.
- Made every runtime mutation and matching webview transition transactional, including rollback of revisions, plans, drafts, cached blocks, confirmed view state, values, profiling ownership, and focus after late failures or cancellations.
- Made terminal runtime cleanup accept the caller's last confirmed revision after an ambiguous mutation, recursively isolated Pandas object cells before live/generated custom code, and aligned live/generated null-versus-NaN filters with saved notebook snapshots.
- Made orderly runtime shutdown drain every session after cleanup faults and return their deterministic aggregate to initiating, joining, and later callers.
- Added a release-blocking warm-dependency/cold-source stdio first-grid gate with per-file Linux cache-eviction evidence, and required the runtime version module in packaged-VSIX verification.
- Added strict nested protocol-v2 request/response validation and semantic correlation at webview, persistence, notebook-output, transport, and coordinator boundaries; transformation parameters are discriminated by operation kind, and malformed kinds, actions, runtime IDs, revisions, columns, export paths, and view IDs cannot publish state.
- Made standalone cancellation wait for the original request's authoritative result, prevented detached-cleanup timeouts from restarting a live shared runtime, and replaced non-authoritative close acknowledgements with one fresh bounded cleanup attempt plus diagnostics.
- Made Jupyter acquisition and bootstrap single-flight and generation-safe under concurrency, applied one deadline across acquisition through response parsing, and prohibited automatic mutation/export/session retries after ambiguous dispatch. A later request reconstructs the last confirmed session before continuing after an uncertain mutation.
- Assigned every live-kernel open a host-known candidate session identity and added bounded failure cleanup, preventing lost or malformed Jupyter output from leaving an unaddressable runtime session.
- Added explicit grid/drawer ownership for progressive summaries, complete confirmed-state rollback after foreground failures, stable-ID filter selection through renames, empty-schema guards, and scroll paging that preserves keyboard focus.
- Pinned persisted plans and recovery requests to the confirmed engine so automatic dependency fallback cannot replay a cleaning plan with different backend semantics.
- Replaced module-only dependency checks with version-aware engine/format probes; DuckDB is accepted only in the tested `>=1.4.5,<1.6` range and dependency installation remains an explicit user-confirmed action.
- Split engine shutdown interruption from request-level cancellation capabilities so DuckDB cleanup can interrupt terminal work without promising cancellation semantics the protocol cannot guarantee.
- Moved preview releases to Marketplace-compatible numeric versions with `preview: true`; the release workflow now validates and publishes one checksummed VSIX byte-for-byte across its platform matrix.

### Changed

- Package publisher changed from `local` to `Matt17BR`.
- File-only use no longer declares Jupyter as a hard extension dependency.
- Supported Python versions are 3.10 through 3.14.
- File-backed Polars CSV/TSV, Parquet, and JSONL inputs now stay lazy through viewing filters, sorts, projections, and page slices.
- GitHub workflows use the current Node 24-based official action majors.
- Custom-editor panels now enable their webview scripts and resources consistently, allowing file sessions to initialize through the contributed editor path.
- Column actions and resizing now provide zoom-safe touch targets plus keyboard resizing; loading, recovery, and generated-code regions expose explicit accessible status/focus semantics.
- Polars nested dtypes are classified by their outer container, Excel sheet indexes follow the public zero-based contract, and failed lazy-file opens no longer retain partial sessions.
- Transformation IR validation now rejects malformed option types, filter predicates, sorts, and group aliases before execution; runtime and generated Pandas/Polars code share deterministic null, category, group, numeric, and Unicode behavior.
- Standalone Python startup is single-flight, restart-safe, and automatically stops after the final session closes.
- Screenshot generation resolves hosted CI Python environments as well as local virtual environments.
- Successful code-copy and script-export notifications no longer hold command completion open while awaiting toast dismissal.
- Notebook kernels receive the packaged pure-Python runtime through the stable execution API and no longer require access to the local extension filesystem.
- Saved notebook snapshots no longer treat null numeric cells as zero, and their multi-column sorts honor explicit null placement independently of direction.
- Visual and accessibility acceptance use the lockfile-pinned Chromium revision, metric-compatible harness font tokens, and always-uploaded CI diffs instead of a moving system-browser/font fallback.
- Real-kernel acceptance uses a single bounded execution deadline with short message polls, tolerating cold shared-runner imports without hiding a hung kernel.
- Webview scrollbars and multi-select states now use VS Code theme tokens for consistent native contrast and deterministic rendering across editor and CI hosts.
- Editor compatibility jobs retry transient VS Code distribution downloads with a bounded backoff.
- Cross-platform checks use a Pandas Index for mixed column labels, platform-native path fixtures, and repository-enforced LF text checkouts, keeping Python 3.10 type analysis and Windows packaging deterministic.

### Release status

- Every in-scope row in the checked-in clean-room parity matrix has automated or recorded acceptance evidence. The version remains on the preview channel until the expanded engine and cross-platform release gates pass; no `1.0.0` tag is created by this preview.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

- Initial Pandas/Polars viewing prototype.
