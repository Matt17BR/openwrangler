# Feature parity matrix

Baseline: Microsoft Data Wrangler 1.24.2, observed and documented on 2026-07-15. This is a clean-room behavior matrix, not an implementation reference.

Status values: **Done** has automated and editor acceptance evidence; **Partial** is usable but incomplete; **Planned** is not release-ready. Data Explorer 1.0 requires every in-scope row to be **Done**.

## Explicitly deferred from 1.0

Copilot operations, Spark, DuckDB, non-dataframe tensor/list renderers, telemetry, and vscode.dev runtime support are out of scope. They must not block the 1.0 matrix and must not be represented as supported.
