# Feature parity matrix

Baseline: Microsoft Data Wrangler 1.24.2, observed and documented on 2026-07-15. This is a clean-room behavior matrix, not an implementation reference.

Status values: **Done** has automated and editor acceptance evidence; **Partial** is usable but incomplete; **Planned** is not release-ready. Data Explorer 1.0 requires every in-scope row to be **Done**.

## Recorded acceptance evidence

Viewing slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 9 TypeScript and 16 Python tests passed. The Polars file test asserts a lazy source and fails if `to_pandas()` is called.
- `npm run test:extension-host` passed against local VS Code 1.128.0, activating the extension, verifying commands/views/settings, and opening `fixtures/sample.csv` through the real custom-editor contribution.
- The allowlisted 44-entry VSIX installed successfully into isolated VS Code 1.128.0 and Cursor 3.11.19 profiles as `matt17br.data-explorer@0.2.0-alpha.1`.
- The in-app browser exercised the built webview at 800px: drawer open/close, advanced OR selection, value-free null predicates, settled progressive requests, keyboard cell navigation, and column search/focus restoration.
- The 1,000 by 40 wide harness retained 7 rendered data columns and 39 rendered rows while exposing the full 41-column/1,001-row accessible grid counts. It jumped to column 39 and fetched rows 201–400 without unbounding the DOM.
- Approved browser baselines are checked into `docs/images/acceptance/` for light, dark, high contrast, 800/1280/1920px widths, and 80/100/150/200% zoom. `docs/images/wide-grid.png` records the wide-grid fixture.

This evidence advances viewing rows to **Partial**, not **Done**. Full interactive Cursor acceptance, malformed/type-edge fixtures, automated accessibility scans, and performance gates are still mandatory.

Editing engine slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 9 TypeScript and 27 Python tests passed. Eleven parameterized operation tests cover the complete 26-operation registry across Pandas and Polars.
- Representative multi-step plans compile to standalone engine-native code and execute to the same semantic output as the runtime adapters.
- Polars transformation tests replace `DataFrame.to_pandas()` with a hard failure. No operation or generated Polars plan crosses through Pandas.

This evidence advances the operation rows to **Partial**. Editor controls, exhaustive typed-edge fixtures, workspace-trust enforcement for custom code, and real-editor acceptance remain mandatory.

Editing session slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 9 TypeScript and 34 Python tests passed. Both engines cover preview, typed page diff, apply, latest-step edit, discard, stale-revision rejection, undo replay, immutable source protection, and viewing-mode rejection.
- Protocol v2 now validates transform steps and carries applied steps, an optional draft, preview diffs, generated code, and plan mutation responses.
- The extension coordinator maintains distinct public/runtime revisions and replays applied steps, the active draft, and the viewing query after runtime replacement.

This evidence advances draft/history rows to **Partial**. Stable identities through structural operations, UI shortcuts, persisted-plan reload, failure-injected editor recovery, and real-editor acceptance remain mandatory.

Editing UI slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 13 TypeScript and 36 Python tests passed. React tests verify all 26 catalog entries, validated form output, explicit conversion of viewing filters into a cleaning step, and structural-step editing against its original input schema.
- `npm run test:extension-host` passed against local VS Code 1.128.0 with the new operation/apply/discard/edit/undo commands registered and the real custom editor opened.
- The in-app browser verified the complete accessible operation dialog and editable generated-code textbox. Automated captures record the operation dialog, draft grid/diff/code layout, and VS Code-token CodeMirror highlighting in `docs/images/acceptance/`.
- Custom-code preview requests are rejected by the extension host when Workspace Trust is absent. CodeMirror is shipped as a dedicated bottom-panel bundle; Monaco is not included.

This evidence keeps editing rows **Partial**. Stable structural identities, packaged reload acceptance, exhaustive operation-edge UI tests, packaged VS Code/Cursor interaction, and keyboard shortcut coverage remain mandatory.

Persistence slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 16 TypeScript and 36 Python tests passed. Persistence tests cover stable source/import keys, replayable-state round trips, and rejection of malformed or unknown saved operations.
- Applied steps, the optional draft, and the independent viewing query are stored in workspace state and replayed through the validated runtime protocol when a source is reopened.
- `npm run test:extension-host` remained green on VS Code 1.128.0 after enabling workspace-state restoration.

This advances reload replay but keeps the row **Partial** until a failure-injected packaged-editor test applies a plan, reloads VS Code and Cursor, and verifies the reconstructed grid and cleanup behavior.

Export slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 16 TypeScript and 43 Python tests passed. Both engines export committed plans to CSV and Parquet; Polars export fails the test if `to_pandas()` is called.
- Runtime tests prove view-only filters do not enter exported data, pending drafts and source overwrite are rejected, successful writes replace an existing destination, and failed writes preserve it while removing temporary files.
- Protocol v2 carries revision-checked export requests and typed completion responses. VS Code commands copy the editable code buffer, save a Python script, and prompt for an explicit cleaned-data destination under Workspace Trust.

This advances export rows to **Partial**. Notebook insertion, command-dialog integration tests, dependency diagnostics for Pandas-to-Parquet export, and packaged VS Code/Cursor interaction remain mandatory.

By-example slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 17 TypeScript and 57 Python tests passed. Candidate fixtures cover slicing, splitting, concatenation with literals, regex extraction/replacement, lower/upper/capitalize, datetime parse/format, constants, and column arithmetic.
- The synthesizer ranks by deterministic complexity and canonical program order, rejects inconsistent examples, revalidates persisted programs, and reports equally simple matches as draft warnings.
- Pandas and Polars execute and compile the same selected AST natively. Cross-engine tests cover string synthesis, datetime formatting, arithmetic, session preview/apply, and a hard Polars-to-Pandas prohibition.
- The operation builder validates example JSON before dispatch; protocol-normalized steps persist the selected program so reload does not reselect a different candidate.

This advances by-example to **Partial**. More compound programs, null/type-edge inference, editable example-row capture from the real grid, keyboard acceptance, and packaged editor testing remain mandatory.

Notebook MIME and insertion slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 20 TypeScript and 62 Python tests passed. New Pandas/Polars helpers emit complete MIME v2 snapshots and remain native; explicit legacy v1 output is still available for fixtures.
- Shared TypeScript normalization upgrades saved v1 metadata to a read-only current session shape and rejects malformed/unknown-version payloads. The renderer registers both MIME identifiers and presents invalid output as an accessible error.
- Formatters are registered inside the active kernel only after trusted stable-API access. Live-variable sources retain their originating notebook URI.
- The insertion command uses the currently edited CodeMirror buffer and a tagged Python cell. The real VS Code extension-host suite applies and verifies the notebook edit against an untitled Jupyter notebook.

This advances notebook rows to **Partial**. Real local/remote kernel formatter display, permission denial, kernel restart, persisted v1 output in packaged VS Code/Cursor, and originating-notebook interaction remain mandatory.

Interface documentation and navigation slice, 2026-07-15:

- `docs/reference.md` is generated from the package command/settings/MIME contributions, Python operation IR registry, and canonical protocol schema. `npm run reference:check` reproduces it in memory and fails on byte-level drift as part of every strict check and package build.
- The extension contributes a native Getting Started walkthrough plus Open Source File and Open Getting Started commands. The extension-host suite verifies all 21 public commands and the walkthrough contribution against a real VS Code host.
- `npm run check`, all 20 TypeScript and 62 Python tests, the VS Code 1.128 extension-host suite, production build, and 51-entry VSIX allowlist verification passed.

This closes public-interface documentation drift and command-surface gaps, but does not advance feature rows to **Done** without the remaining packaged cross-editor acceptance.

Identity and structural-diff slice, 2026-07-15:

- Both engines attach private session row identities and preserve them through filters, sorts, projections, row deletion, and value transformations. Group/custom results receive a new identity generation; no identity enters user schema, profiling, duplicate counts, custom-code input, generated code, or CSV/Parquet exports.
- Column lineage is independent of names and positions. Automated tests cover rename, reorder, deletion, latest-step replacement, group keys/aggregates, and duplicate Pandas labels with deterministic IDs.
- Page diffs now join rows and columns by identity, so a sort is no longer reported as changed cells and a rename is no longer reported as a remove/add pair. Group replacements report the old and new row sets explicitly.
- All 20 TypeScript and 69 Python tests pass, including native Pandas/Polars lineage fixtures and the hard Polars-to-Pandas prohibition. Pandas viewing additionally covers duplicate and non-string labels; the 52-entry production VSIX passes the package allowlist.

This advances structural diff and typed-edge evidence but keeps the rows **Partial** until identifier-based operation parameters, packaged editor interaction, and the remaining nested/type matrix are green.

Jupyter recovery slice, 2026-07-15:

- A real local IPykernel test bootstraps the bundled agent, registers automatic MIME v2 formatters, renders live Pandas and Polars dataframes, opens both engines through protocol v2, restarts the kernel, bootstraps again, and receives a valid response after restart.
- The extension kernel lifecycle caches and bootstraps once, performs at most one reacquire/bootstrap retry after execution failure, and never retries acquisition/permission denial or cancellation. Configured timeouts actively cancel kernel execution before recovery.
- All 25 TypeScript and 70 Python tests pass. The lifecycle suite covers success, restart, repeated failure, denial/cancellation, and timeout; the real-kernel test guarantees cleanup in `finally`, and the 53-entry production VSIX passes its allowlist.

This advances notebook recovery and formatter evidence but keeps the notebook rows **Partial** until remote kernels and packaged VS Code/Cursor permission, restart, saved-output, and originating-notebook interaction are recorded.

Packaged editor slice, 2026-07-15:

- The 53-entry allowlisted VSIX installed into fresh VS Code 1.128.0 and Cursor 3.11.19 user/extension directories. Tests ran from a separate harness extension, ensuring no TypeScript checkout or development extension shadowed `matt17br.data-explorer@0.2.0-alpha.1`.
- Both editors activated the package, verified its publisher/gallery and Activity Bar assets, all 21 commands, Getting Started walkthrough, and v1/v2 MIME contributions. Each opened the CSV custom editor, completed a real Polars runtime session through the packaged Python source, reopened the exact source URI, and applied a real notebook cell edit.
- This stronger test exposed and fixed the custom-editor path failing to enable webview scripts; previous tab-only extension-host acceptance could not detect that the runtime session never opened. Open Source File now also waits briefly for an in-flight active session instead of blocking on a notification.
- Linux CI now installs and exercises the VSIX against current VS Code after allowlist verification. Local release acceptance auto-detects and repeats the package test in Cursor without touching normal profiles.

This advances cross-editor/package evidence but keeps UI rows **Partial** until the full operation/export/reload/theme interaction checklist and screenshots are recorded from both packaged editors.

Visual and accessibility hardening slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm run test:webview-acceptance` renders the production editor, notebook renderer, and Code Preview bundles into 23 Playwright-readable harnesses. It compares actual screenshots against checked-in baselines with an anti-aliasing-tolerant 1% pixel-delta gate and never mutates baselines during verification.
- Automated axe runs cover WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 A/AA rules across dark, light, high-contrast dark/light, 800/1280/1920px widths, 80/100/150/200% zoom, operation/draft/by-example states, and explicit empty/loading/error/recovery/Unicode fixtures. Every non-minor violation is a CI failure.
- Scan findings produced product fixes: column menus and resizers now remain 24px targets at 80% zoom, resizers support Arrow/Home/End keys, generated-code overflow is keyboard focusable, empty grids announce `No rows`, and status/error regions use live semantics. Light-theme type labels now meet contrast requirements.

This advances theme and accessibility evidence but keeps the row **Partial** until the same core theme/zoom checklist is recorded in packaged VS Code and Cursor.

## Explicitly deferred from 1.0

Copilot operations, Spark, DuckDB, non-dataframe tensor/list renderers, telemetry, and vscode.dev runtime support are out of scope. They must not block the 1.0 matrix and must not be represented as supported.
