# Feature parity matrix

Baseline: Microsoft Data Wrangler 1.24.2, observed and documented on 2026-07-15. This is a clean-room behavior matrix, not an implementation reference.

Status values: **Done** has automated and editor acceptance evidence; **Partial** is usable but incomplete; **Planned** is not release-ready. Data Explorer 1.0 requires every in-scope row to be **Done**.

## Recorded acceptance evidence

Viewing slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 9 TypeScript and 16 Python tests passed. The Polars file test asserts a lazy source and fails if `to_pandas()` is called.
- `npm run test:extension-host` passed against local VS Code 1.128.0, activating the extension, verifying commands/views/settings, and opening `fixtures/sample.csv` through the real custom-editor contribution.
- The allowlisted 44-entry VSIX installed successfully into isolated VS Code 1.128.0 and Cursor 3.11.19 profiles as `matt17br.data-explorer@0.2.0-alpha.1`.
- The in-app browser exercised the built webview at 800px: drawer open/close, advanced OR selection, value-free null predicates, settled progressive requests, keyboard cell navigation, and column search/focus restoration.
- The 1,000 by 40 wide harness retained 7 rendered data columns and 39 rendered rows while exposing the full 41-column/1,001-row accessible grid counts. It jumped to column 39 and fetched rows 201–400 without unbounding the DOM.
- Approved browser baselines are checked into `docs/images/acceptance/` for light, dark, high contrast, 800/1280/1920px widths, and 80/100/150/200% zoom. `docs/images/wide-grid.png` records the wide-grid fixture.

This evidence advances viewing rows to **Partial**, not **Done**. Full interactive Cursor acceptance, malformed/type-edge fixtures, automated accessibility scans, and performance gates are still mandatory.

Editing engine slice, 2026-07-15:

- `npm test`: 9 TypeScript and 27 Python tests passed. Eleven parameterized operation tests cover the complete 26-operation registry across Pandas and Polars.
- Representative multi-step plans compile to standalone engine-native code and execute to the same semantic output as the runtime adapters.
- Polars transformation tests replace `DataFrame.to_pandas()` with a hard failure. No operation or generated Polars plan crosses through Pandas.

This evidence advances the operation rows to **Partial**. Draft protocol/session state, preview diffs, editor controls, exhaustive typed-edge fixtures, workspace-trust enforcement for custom code, and real-editor acceptance remain mandatory.

## Explicitly deferred from 1.0

Copilot operations, Spark, DuckDB, non-dataframe tensor/list renderers, telemetry, and vscode.dev runtime support are out of scope. They must not block the 1.0 matrix and must not be represented as supported.
